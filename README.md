# Redis Leaderboard
A primitive interactive leaderboard designed in Python leveraging Redis running on the localhost.

### What is it? ###
----
A primitive interactive leaderboard with non duplicate designed in Python leveraging Redis. For the purposes of demonstration,
a very primitive user model has been constructured as following.

```

class User:
    """A model user having a name, country, email and a score"""

    def __init__(self, name, country, email score=0):
        self.name = name
        self.email = email
        self.country = country
        self.score = score

```
Moreover, it's been assumed that the primary key for any user is it's *email*.
The decision as to why the *email* was chosen as the primary key is because in any major competetion that boasts
of a leaderboard, the players always have either a unique username or a unique email.
People are welcome to switch email to usernames.

### Prerequisites ###
---
* Python 3.6.1 or above.
* Redis python library. To install

    ```$pip install redis```

### How do I get started ###
---
* Fire up a terminal. 

    ```$ python redis-leaderboard.py```

   * The program shall run an event loop during which you are free to enter commands so as to modify the leaderboard.
   * Few users have been upserted by default for user convenience.
   * Every command returns a pretty human readable message/current state of the leaderboard.
   * Program, by default refers to redis synchronously. Hence, changes made during one instance of program would 
     continue to persist. To avoid persistent, uncomment ```r.flushall()```
